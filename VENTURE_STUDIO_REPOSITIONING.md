## Key Changes Made

### 1. Hero Section Repositioning
**Before:**
> "Infonaut is a purpose-built engine for automating the economy"
> "Streamline growth, deploy autonomous agents, and execute strategy at the speed of AI"
> CTA: "Start Building"

**After:**
> "We build autonomous companies"
> "Infonaut is an AI venture studio. We design, build, and scale autonomous companies powered by AI agents. Meet our portfolio: GroX, Xgent, and more coming next quarter."
> CTA: "Partner With Us"

**Impact:** ✅ Clear venture studio positioning

---

### 2. Removed Pricing Section
**Why:**
- saas.group doesn't have pricing (they build FOR companies, not sell TO companies)
- Infonaut is B2B2B (venture studio model), not B2B (SaaS)
- Pricing signals direct sales, venture studios signal investment/partnerships

**Impact:** ✅ Eliminates confusion about business model

---

### 3. Removed Comparison Table
**Why:**
- Comparing against Linear, Notion, Asana is irrelevant for venture studio
- saas.group doesn't compare themselves to other studios
- Venture studios compete on portfolio, not features

**Impact:** ✅ Removes noise, sharpens positioning

---

### 4. Updated "Method" Section
**Before:**
> "The Infonaut Method"
> "Most companies hire humans to do robot work. We build robots to do human work."

**After:**
> "The Infonaut Approach"
> "We don't just build software. We build autonomous companies from the ground up. Each portfolio company is designed to operate independently, powered by AI agents, and scaled to profitability through our venture studio model."

**Impact:** ✅ Explains venture studio approach

---

### 5. Updated Roadmap

- Q1 2026: Multi-turn planning agents
- Q2 2026: Video understanding models

- Q3 2026: Infonaut Academy launch, 4th portfolio company
- Q4 2026: IPO preparation, 10+ portfolio companies, Global expansion

**Impact:** ✅ Shows venture studio growth trajectory

---

### 6. Updated Final CTA
**Before:**
> "Ready to automate?"
> "Join the waiting list for our next cohort of partners"
> CTAs: "Get Early Access", "Contact Sales"

**After:**
> "We're Building Next"
> "Q1 2026: Launching our 3rd portfolio company. We're looking for visionary founders and strategic partners to join us."
> CTAs: "Apply as Founder", "Invest in Infonaut"

**Impact:** ✅ Clear calls-to-action for studio positioning

---

### 7. Enhanced Contact Form
**Added:**
- Interest dropdown: "I'm a Founder" / "I'm an Investor" / "I'm a Strategic Partner"
- Updated message placeholder: "Tell us about your vision" (instead of generic)
- Button text: "Get in Touch" (instead of "Send Message")

**Impact:** ✅ Form captures intent, not just leads

### GroX
> "Growth Intelligence Company"
> "GroX isn't just an auto-poster. It's a sentient growth engine that analyzes viral hooks, engages with high-value accounts, and converts followers into leads automatically."

### Xgent
> "Autonomous Workforce Company"
> "Xgent deploys autonomous agents into your Slack, CRM, and Email. They don't just chat; they perform actions. From finding leads to closing deals, Xgent handles the grunt work."

**These now read as:** Infonaut's first two portfolio companies, with future companies to follow.
