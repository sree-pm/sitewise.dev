## DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR REBUILD

1. **Typography First**: Every section starts with perfect hierarchy
2. **Breathing Room**: 20% minimum whitespace on every section
3. **Depth Through Shadows**: Every element has semantic elevation
4. **Purposeful Animation**: Only animations that enhance UX
5. **Color as Information**: Not just decoration - drives hierarchy
6. **Consistent Rhythm**: Spacing scale never breaks
7. **Micro-copy**: Every CTA, label, and instruction is premium
8. **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance, proper contrast
9. **Performance**: Lazy loading, image optimization, smooth animations
10. **Mobile-First**: Rebuild for mobile, scale up
